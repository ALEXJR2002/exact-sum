# exact-sum

### **Input**
Each test case starts with 2 ≤ N ≤ 10000, the number of available books. Next line will have N
integers, representing the price of each book, a book costs less than 1000001. Then there is another
line with an integer M, representing how much money Peter has. There is a blank line after each test
case. The input is terminated by end of file (EOF).

### **Output**
For each test case you must print the message: ‘Peter should buy books whose prices are i and
j.’, where i and j are the prices of the books whose sum is equal do M and i ≤ j. You can consider that
is always possible to find a solution, if there are multiple solutions print the solution that minimizes
the difference between the prices i and j. After each test case you must print a blank line.
